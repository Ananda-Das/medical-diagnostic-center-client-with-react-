My Medical Diagnostic project is used for Booking the Medical Diagnostic Test Booking & Get the Result. To make this Project I have used React Js With Tailwind CSS Framework & Daiusyui. For The Authentication Part, I have used Firebase and JWT Token.


In this Project, a user can use some functionality. I am describing it Below: 

- A user can see Tests offered by Medicare. 
- A user can easily redirect from one page to another by using Navbar.
- To see the particular Test Details a user needs to log themselves to our website.
- A user can manually register with email, name, photo, District, Upazila, and password.
- After successful registration user can log in to see the test details and book the Test.
- When the user tries to book a test he/she needs to pay the test price using the Stripe payment Method.
- Users can use coupon codes if they have any coupon codes during the booking.
- After booking a test the result is pending.
- Admin can see all the user & their details.
- Admin Can change any user role.
- Admin can update the test result and users can download the result as a pdf.
